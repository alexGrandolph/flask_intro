My first Flask App!
This app is my first application using Python/Flask.  It is a basic CRUD app for creating, updating, and deleting the tasks on my To Do list.
Thank you to freeCodeCamp.org on youtube.
I deployed this app to Heroku, which can be found here: https://flask-tasks-tutorial.herokuapp.com/
